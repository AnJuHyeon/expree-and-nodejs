I miss the taste of your lips on Sunday And the sound of your laugh whrn I say 
something funny but nobody heard it except for you and my mom still ask about you
I lie and say we friendly Cause I don't have it in me , to tell the truth
you and me what are we if we not together it could be nothing cause nothing last 
forever.
